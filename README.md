### Hi there, I'm Bianca! 👋
*You can also call me Bee!* 🐝

---

I'm a full-stack software engineer and a creative, analytical thinker who has experience building applications using JavaScript, React, Python, Flask, and SQL. My detail-oriented approach lends itself well to catching bugs and parsing through data, while my skills in cross-functional collaboration and communication keep my team organized and on the same page. After seven years of working with students with disabilities, I learned to code to help companies create engaging and accessible applications for users.
